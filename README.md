React Native Fitness Tracker

Objective: To create a React Native fitness tracker app that allows users to log their workouts,
track their progress, and set fitness goals. The app should provide a simple and intuitive user
interface, with options for customizing workouts, setting reminders, and viewing progress
charts.


## Requirements:
* The app should be built using React Native and target both Android and iOS
platforms.
* Utilize TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability.
* The app should have a clean, modern, and responsive UI/UX design.
* Use the latest version of React Native and any necessary libraries.
* Implement proper error handling and user input validation.
* Integrate the app with a RESTful backend for data storage and retrieval.
* Implement end-to-end testing with Wix/Detox and unit testing with react-native/testing-library.
* Set up CI/CD using Bitrise or a similar service.
* The project should be completed in 6-12 hours.

## Project Description:

The app should have the following features:
* User authentication (Sign up, Login, and Logout)
* Create and manage workouts (Add, Update, and Remove exercises, sets, and reps)
* Set and track fitness goals (e.g., weekly workout frequency, target weight, or distance)
* Workout reminders and notifications
* Progress visualization through charts and graphs
* Integration with a RESTful backend for data storage and retrieval
* User profile screen with account management options

## Deliverables
* React Native app source code, written in TypeScript, along with any necessary
libraries and dependencies
* Documentation on how to set up, run, and deploy the project
* Test suite for end-to-end testing with Wix/Detox and unit testing with react-native/testing-library
* CI/CD configuration using Bitrise or a similar service
